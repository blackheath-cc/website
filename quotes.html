			<h4>Elizabeth:</h4>
			<p>I really enjoy doing the BCC. I get to learn coding (which is complicated, but fun) and make new friends with other kids I didn't know before. Rob and Lily are great teachers, they help and are very patient with kids like us! I enjoy the BCC a lot and it's very fun and worth my spare time on a Sunday afternoon!</p>

			<h4>Charlotte:</h4>
			<p>I really enjoy BCC, it has made me use my computer not just for the internet but to look more into what a computer can actually do!</p>

			<h4>Rebecca:</h4>
			<p>I find coding really enjoyable because we get to learn new I.T skills, we will need these modern skills in future life. I think coding is a great idea for children because in future life it will be essential, hence our slogan: 'Coding For The Future'. If you want to learn to code I recomend Code Accademy and Rob and Lily as teachers!</p>

			<h4>Elizabeth:</h4>
			<p>I have really enjoyed the first few months of BCC and I have personally learnt a lot! I am extremely thankful to Rob and Lily for teaching us the concept of coding and making web sites. So far it has been an amazing experiance for me and I am looking forward to winning YRS!</p>
